# React Component Exercise

This project includes a stateless React component named `SimpleComponent`.

We would like you to make the following changes to this component:
* Add a `color` prop that sets the background color.
* Add stateful logic so that when the component is clicked, the background color is toggled on or off.
* Make it so that by default, the background color should be disabled on component mount.

Make sure you've finished all of the previous items before proceeding. 

You should not have to modify your implementation of `SimpleComponent` for this last step: 
* Create a component that allows the user to specify the background color for the rendered `SimpleComponent`.
